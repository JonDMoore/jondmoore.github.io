I'm a software tester by day and Lutheran lay-deacon.....also by day. What is a lay-deacon you ask? Its basically a regular deacon, but with less formal theological training who doesn't (usually) get paid. What's a regular deacon? READ A BOOK.

More importantly though, Im a husband and a father of three. I enjoy reading, coffee, and annoying my family. I like to force myself to write about religion, sci-fi/fantasy, and cultural issues. I hope you enjoy my site.
