I'm a software tester by day and Lutheran lay-deacon.....also by day. What is a lay-deacon you ask? Its basically a deacon with less formal theological training who doesn't (usually) get paid. More importantly though, Im a husband and a father of three. I enjoy reading, coffee, and annoying my family. Enjoy the site.
