Well, its been a long time coming, but I'm going to finally start committing to writing in this blog regularly. 

Right now, I'm studying for the New Testament ELCE (Entry Level Competency Exams) for seminary, and I'm having a hard time finding specifically Lutheran resources. Granted, most resources that I have found outside of the assigned textbook have been well made and largely orthodox in their teaching. However, it would be nice if someone put together a series of videos or (digestible) lectures that cover the specific material for the exams. While there are abundant resources for survey-level New and Old Testament information, I'm sure I wonâ€™t be as fortunate when it comes time to prepare for the ELCE on Lutheran doctrine. 

Perhaps if I ever find some spare time again, I'll put together a review podcast.
